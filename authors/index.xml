      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a PhD student in Machine Learning at the University of Cambridge, having started in October 2019. The first year of my PhD was spent at Oxford, before I moved with the rest of my research group to Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a member of the Machine Learning Systems group in the Computer Science department, where I am supervised by Professor Nic Lane. As an undergraduate and master&#39;s student, I worked with Dr Robert Harle and Professor Cecilia Mascolo on two projects related to pervasive computation and wearable devices. Most recently, I worked at Facebook&#39;s London office during the summer of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
