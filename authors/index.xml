      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: I am currently on the job market, with a planned graduation date in &lt;em&gt;summer 2022&lt;/em&gt;. Please feel free to reach out if you are interested in recruiting me! My email address can be found at the bottom of this page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a 3rd year PhD student in Machine Learning at the University of Cambridge, having started in October 2019. I am a member of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mlsys.cst.cam.ac.uk/&#34;&gt;Machine Learning Systems group&lt;/a&gt; in the Computer Science department, where I am supervised by &lt;a href=&#34;http://niclane.org/&#34;&gt;Dr Nic Lane&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research interests focus on enabling edge devices to reason from non-uniformly structured data efficiently. The research in my PhD so far has focused on enabling efficient inference for graph neural networks (GNNs), which have a variety of useful applications which are currently not viable for edge platforms.
I am interested in hardware-software co-design techniques, systems challenges, and applications.
To date, my work has won multiple &lt;strong&gt;best paper&lt;/strong&gt; awards.&lt;/p&gt;
