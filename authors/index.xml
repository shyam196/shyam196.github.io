      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am moving to Oxford to pursue a DPhil (PhD) in Machine Learning, starting in October 2019. Before starting my DPhil I spent 4 successful years as an undergraduate and master&amp;rsquo;s student in Computer Science at Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Oxford, I will be a member of the Machine Learning Systems group in the Computer Science department, where I will be supervised by Professor Nic Lane. While I was at Cambridge, I worked with Dr Robert Harle and Professor Cecilia Mascolo on two projects related to pervasive computation and wearable devices. I also worked at Facebook&amp;rsquo;s London office during the summer of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
